# Llibrary for delays (time intervals) that do not stop the main loop from executing.

Create as many delays as you want with:
MyDelay myDelay1(1000); -> 1000 is time interval in milliseconds when your code can be executed

Here are implemented functions:
isInterval(); -> check if interval time has expired and execute your code
start(); -> starts executing delay
stop(); -> stop executing delay
resume(); -> resumes executing delay
setInterval(unsigned long milliseconds); -> change interval time on existing delay
